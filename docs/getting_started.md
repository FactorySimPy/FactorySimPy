# Getting Started with FactorySimPy

Welcome to **FactorySimPy** – a lightweight, open-source component library for **discrete-event simulation (DES)** of manufacturing systems, built on top of [SimPy 4.1.1](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/4.1.1/).

This guide will help you get up and running in just a few minutes.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install FactorySimPy using `pip`. Make sure you have Python ≥ 3.8.

### 1. Install SimPy (if not already installed)
```bash
pip install simpy
```

### 2. Install FactorySimPy

**From PyPI:**
```bash
pip install factorysimpy
```

**From GitHub (latest version):**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FactorySimPy/FactorySimPy.git
```

## ✨ What You Can Model

FactorySimPy lets you simulate typical manufacturing scenarios using ready-made building blocks like:
- **Machine** is a node with configurable processing delay
- **Split** and **Join** are nodes for splitting a flow into two or joining two flows
- **Buffers**,**Conveyors** and **Fleets** are entities of type edge for transfering items from one node to another
- **Sources** and **Sinks** for generating and collecting items


All components can be customized, and extended easily.
